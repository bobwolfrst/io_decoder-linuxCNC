io_decoder-linuxCNC | Changelog
Version: 1.1.0 Status: Stable Date: 2026-02-08

Major Improvements
Asynchronous Keyboard Threading: Moved the keyboard emulation logic (uinput) from the Real-Time HAL thread to a dedicated user-space thread.

Why: This prevents any potential system latency or "blocking" in the keyboard handler from affecting the high-priority Real-Time CNC operations.

Resource Protection: Improved thread safety when accessing shared memory between the HAL component and the keyboard emulator.

Documentation & Code Quality
English Translation: Fully translated all source code comments from Italian to English.

Code Cleanup: Removed unused variables and optimized the main loop to reduce CPU overhead.

Improved Error Handling: Added more descriptive terminal outputs if the USB device or uinput fails to initialize.

Fixes
Fixed a potential "zombie process" issue by ensuring clean thread termination upon hal_exit.

Refined the uinput setup to be more compatible with recent Linux kernels used in LinuxCNC 2.9+.

How to update
